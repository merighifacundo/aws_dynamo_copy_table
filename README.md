## Motivation

Why a inquirer based AWS DynamoDB table copy utility?

I didn't find at the time a good way to copy a table across environments.
So I built a way to do it with enquirer which let's you copy even to a local DynamoDB instance.

## Features

- Written in JS separating questions and the copy process.
- Easy to run.
